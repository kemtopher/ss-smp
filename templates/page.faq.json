Pricing for the membership is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>$10 Month or Save $20 with a $100 Annual Membership</strong></li></ul><h3>Transactional Fees</h3><p>Sellers will incur two types of fees on their order.</p><p><strong>Processing Fee</strong></p><p>The first is a processing fee. This fee will sometimes be referred to as a gateway fee. Ship My Plants utilizes Stripe to process payments - their fee is 2.9% + 30¢ of the total transaction. The total transaction refers to the product subtotal and applicable taxes and shipping.</p><p><strong>Commission Fee</strong></p><p>Ship My Plants charges a 10% fee on the final sale price of each item sold. This fee only applies to products and not applicable taxes or shipping.</p><p>Something to consider. Some sellers choose to bundle shipping costs into the price of their product. This is great for offering \"free shipping\" promotions. However, be aware that markups for shipping/handling on the retail price of your product will be included in our 10% commission fee.</p>"

            "text": "<p><a href=\"https://www.netpsplantfinder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NetPS Plant Database</a> is a tool known to many in the garden center industry as Net PS Plant Finder. The tool provides searchable plant information for your customers' care needs. The NetPS Plant Database has been integrated into the Ship My Plants platform. What does that mean? Gone are the hours spent keying tedious plant data into your online plant listings. With Ship My Plants, sellers can easily import plants directly into their online shop. The plant listings come equip with all of the product data, attributes and photos you may need. Sellers can go in and update any of the information to their own specs along with sku, price, and inventory.</p><p><strong>We are currently testing Plant Finder functionality and will include further use instructions upon completion.</strong></p><h3>Customization is Key</h3><p>We love NetPS Plant Database because it gives plant buyers all of the information they need about the plants you sell, this includes photos and care requirements.</p><p>However, online plant shoppers appreciate seeing the product that will arrive to their doorstep. Customizing your listings will help you differentiate your shop from other plant sellers with similar listings. Here are a few recommendations on how to do that:</p><ul><li><strong>Upload your own product photos.</strong><br/>The NetPS Plant Database image library does an amazing job of showcasing various plants at maturity or seasonal interest. Compliment those images by including additional reference photos of the products you intend to ship.</li><li><strong>Tell us more about your plants!</strong><br/>Adding your plant's own unique story of how it was cultivated and where is a nice touch to make for a unique listing.</li><li><strong>Maintain Inventory & Pricing</strong><br/>You, as the seller, are responsible for maintaining your pricing and inventory on your products. You will need to complete this information prior to publishing your listings.</li></ul>"
